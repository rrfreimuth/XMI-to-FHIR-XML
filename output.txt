			An abstract entity representing the sharable meaning expressed in a particular Assertion.
Propositions are sharable statements of purported truth. They represent the core fact or meaning that is put forth as true in an Assertion. They are 'sharable' in that the same Proposition can be expressed in separate Assertions made by different Agents, on different occasions. As truth bearers, Propositions are either true or false.
